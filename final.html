			<p>Affordable housing has been a long-standing issue within the city of Syracuse. But in recent years, housing that is safe and livable has been increasingly difficult to come across for many residents within the city. Whether it’s through issues with heating, sewage, or lead paint, unfit properties are becoming more common within the Syracuse community. Since 2020, 218 properties within the city have been registered as unfit by the Codes Department of Syracuse. These properties have been registered under the 2020 Property Maintenance Code of New York State (PMCNYS). For a property to be deemed unfit, the structure has to lack sanitation, ventilation, heat, or other facilities that protect the health and safety of its residents.</p>
			
			<p>A majority of 2020 PMCNYS violations stem from poor upkeep of the interior. 74% percent of unfit properties under the classification cited interior property maintenance as the main complaint.</p>
			
			<p>Gretchen Purser, a professor at the Maxwell School of Citizenship at Syracuse University, explained how unfit properties in Syracuse stems from 2 main issues - in a written statement to JNL 221.</p>
			
			<p>Purser said that the crises of affordable housing and habilitity characterize a scourge of old and poorly upkept properties that have plagued Syracuse for years. “Those very old and very poorly kept up properties, which are rife with code violations, are still extremely profitable for landlords.” Purser said. “So what the research shows is that landlords actually make a killing off of leasing apartments that are in really decrepit, horrible conditions and charging tenants an arm and a leg for them.”</p>

			<h3>Widespread Effects of Unfit Properties</h3>
			<p>It’s through this mindset from landlords that many unfit properties are unable to be salvaged. Across the 218 unfit properties classified under the 2020 PMCNYS violation, more than half were permanently listed as unfit, meaning there was no corrective action that could be taken to remove the violation. Among the most common issues with these unsalvageable properties were no heat, no water, broken sewage, and fire damage. These uncorrected actions made up more than 64% of the properties that were permanently listed as unfit.</p>
			<p>Unfit properties in Syracuse have also contributed to another rising issue in the city, lead poisoning. A <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/news/2023/09/syracuses-children-suffer-from-trail-of-lead-paint-ignored-by-landlords-its-like-they-dont-care.html" target="_blank"> 2023 article</a> from Michelle Breidenbach of syracuse.com revealed that tenants with government subsidies continue to pay $800 to $1200 a month to live in homes with chipping and peeling paint. This causes children who live in these homes to be subject to the effects of lead poisoning, which can include anemia, problems with executive functioning, speech delay, as well as heightened anxiety and anger issues. According to data from the Onondaga County Health Department, the number of children found to have elevated lead levels has risen nearly 130% percent since the start of the pandemic.</p>
			<p>Despite these glaring issues that are present in many of Syracuse’s oldest properties, landlords have shown little motivation to fix them. A <a href="https://app.box.com/s/6h77dflf4kqo9ack97foh5t0mtrzd6ch" target="_blank"> 2022 housing survey</a> conducted by the City of Syracuse found that across 35,000 residential properties, a third of them showed signs of chronic disinvestment. Additionally, out of the city’s 28 neighborhoods, only 4 had 60% or more of their residential properties show healthy signs of upkeep and investment.

			<h3>What's next?</h3>
			<p>However, tenant organizations within the city are taking the steps necessary to ensure the protection of homeowners from having to live in unfit conditions. Purser, who is a member of the Syracuse Tenants Union, explained how the union is working to expand the rental registry to include all properties within the city. It would include a mandatory inspection process, and would prohibit landlords from evicting tenants not on the registry. “So it's a way of enforcing some kind of inspection.” Purser said. “Because without it, basically what happens is that we have a code enforcement system that's based on tenants complaining, but tenants are powerless and tenants are poor and tenants are terrified.”</p>

			<p>Another policy that has been suggested by city officials and other tenant organizations are ‘good cause eviction’ protections. The assembly bill was proposed to New York state congress a few weeks ago, and it seeks to hold property owners accountable by capping rent increases, and making landlords show they have a legal reason for not renewing a rental lease. Jocelyn Richards, who is also a member of the Syracuse Tenants Union, stated in <a href="https://www.waer.org/news/2024-04-10/syracuse-tenants-rights-advocates-want-good-cause-eviction-protections-from-state-leaders" target="_blank">an article published by WAER</a> that economically vulnerable renters don’t have enough protection from losing their homes if they need repairs. “‘Good cause’ would really help keep people in their homes as we see homelessness skyrocketing in Syracuse,” Richards said. “We need to keep families in a stable situation.”</p>

			<p>While there still is more data being collected on unfit properties in Syracuse, their effects have a wide outreach on the city’s community as a whole. As Syracuse continues to build more new housing in preparation for Micron, it’s important for the city to use its data to address issues with older housing that have plagued it for far too long.
